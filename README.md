Enable easy prototyping of blockchain applications

Blockchain technology is opening up new possibilities and has the potential to disrupt a broad range of industries. Creating Smart Contracts with technologies like Ethereum and Hyperledger is a relatively easy programming task but creating applications that can interface with those Smart Contracts to solve real-world problems is still very time-consuming.

This project aims to combine the power of Smart Contracts with the rapid development capability of low-code development environments to facilitate the rapid prototyping of real-world blockchain applications.
